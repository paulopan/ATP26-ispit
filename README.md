## History
User experience design is a [conceptual design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_design)  discipline rooted in [human factors and ergonomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics). This field since the late 1940s has focused on the interaction between human users, machines, and contextual environments to design systems that address the user's experience.[4] [User experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) became a positive insight for designers in the early 1990s with the proliferation of workplace computers.[citation needed] [Don Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman), a professor and researcher in design, usability, and cognitive science, coined the term "user experience", and brought it to a wider audience that is inside our modernized society.[5]

>I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow. I wanted to cover all aspects of the person's experience with the system including industrial design graphics, the interface, the physical interaction and the manual. Since then the term has spread widely, so much so that it is starting to lose its meaning.

## Elements
**Research**  
*Main article: [User research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_research)*  

User experience design draws from design approaches like [human-computer interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) and [user-centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design), and includes elements from similar disciplines like [interaction design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design), [visual design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_design), [information architecture]([information architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture), [user research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_research), and others.

Another portion of the research is understanding the end-user and the purpose of the application. Though this might seem clear to the designer, stepping back and empathizing with the user will yield the best results.

It helps to identify and prove or disprove assumptions, find commonalities across target audience members, and recognize their needs, goals, and mental models.
